# Smart-Traffic-Light-Control-System-Arduino
Easy deployable smart traffic light controlling system using arduino and sensors. 
This system is made using 1 arduino uno and an ultrasound sensor and 3 led bulbs <I> (to stimulate traffic lights) </I> for each lane. 

The code is light, simple and fast. It does not use any Machine language algorithms, or cameras.

You could use 2 sensors in each lane if you want to find length of the vehicle too. But that is optional for now.

Refer code traffic1lane.ino for the main purpose. Other code snippets are for extended features. You could add those if you need.

The extended features are still in beta mode
